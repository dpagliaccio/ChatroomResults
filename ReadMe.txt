Neural Sensitivity to Peer Feedback and Depression Symptoms in Adolescents: 
A 2-Year Multi-wave Longitudinal Study
David Pagliaccio, Poornima Kumar, Rahil A. Kamath, Diego A. Pizzagalli, 
& Randy P. Auerbach


Whole-brain 3D NIFTI images are presented for the group-level results for the 2 contrasts of interest:
1. High-Value Cue+Anticipation (when particiapnt was interested vs not) = "CUE_INTvNOT"
2. High-Value Feedback rejection vs. acceptance = "FB_ARvAA"

-Group-average task effects (which regions are activated by the task) are presented in "groupT" files, i.e. T-statistics for the all participants vs. zero t-test
-Group-level linear mixed effects model results for the brain x peer stress interaction predicting depression over time are presented in the "brainXstress" files, i.e. the chi-squared statistic for the interaction (note this will all be positive)

All files include unthresholded results in the first volume and cluster-corrected results in the second volume
